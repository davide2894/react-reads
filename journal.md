# Day 3 - Thu 10/5/18
6:18am - I set up the project and made a plan to build it. 
First of all I am going to make the static version of the app (props). Then I will focus on interactions (state).

One of the advantages of React is that it makes it possible to separate logic from the rendering. So in the same component file I can separate how I want it to work from how I want it to look.

TODO: 
v make header component
...
Header component created. 

TODO: create Book component
